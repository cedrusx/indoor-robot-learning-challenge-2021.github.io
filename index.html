<h2> Me and this website </h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Your description aaaaaaaa More recently, service robots have emerged as a highlight for both academic and industrial field. Applications faced to public tend to be more mature, such as public service robots in locations such as airports and hotels, but developments are not limited to. There are even greater potential in applications that are more personal, private, and customized, such as home assistant, elderly care, smart retail etc. Beyond all the achievements, the long-time technology bottleneck is robot learing capability. That is, just the mainstream supervised learing (including Deep Learning) based ion pre-annoated data is not good enough for robotic applications that requires learning continuously in perception, manipulation, and interaction with users. Indoor environment therefore provides an ideal environment for continuous learning, since robots therefore have opportunities interacting with their surroundings more effectively. </p>
